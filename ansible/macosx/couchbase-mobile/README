Setup Mobile MACOS

Prereq
1. Setup a mac agent on mobile jenkins https://mobile.jenkins.couchbase.com using JNLP connection.
   Make a note of the agent's name and jnlp secret.  These are required when running the ansible
   command at step 6.
2. Create a new Mac VM and install appropriate version of xcode as needed. VM ova and iso might be
    available on latestbuild.  If not, it will need to be downloaded from https://developer.apple.com

Deploy tools via ansible
1. git clone https://github.com/couchbase/build.git
2. cd build/ansible/macosx/couchbase-mobile
3. Download MacOS codesign cert, from lastpass. unzip it to files directory so that it becomes
   files/Certificates.p12
4. Ensure a copy of the following file in ssh directory
       buildbot_id_dsa
       config
       id_ns-codereview
       id_rsa
       ns-buildbot.rsa
       patch_via_gerrit.ini
5. Ensure a copy of jenkins-appledeveloper.developerprofile in files directory
    info is in team's lastpass database
6. Run the playbook and enter sudo password
    % ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml  -e "jenkins_node_name=<agent node name>
       jenkins_jnlp_secret=<jnlp secret>" --ask-become-pass


NOTES:
   * Starting from bigsur, the agent should be launch using JNLP connection.
   Based on observation, bigsur+ no longer allows tests to be run through ssh session.
   Often tests are failed with errors such as "Underlying Error: Couldnâ€™t communicate
   with a helper application. ...The connection to service on pid 0 named
   com.apple.testmanagerd.control was invalidated."

   * After an agent is first created, the command to start the agent including jnlp secret
   is displayed.  i.e.

   echo <a long string of jnlp secret code> secret-file
   java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl https://mobile.jenkins.couchbase.com/computer/
   mobile-cbl-macosx-02/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @secret-file -workDir "/Users/couchbase/jenkins"

   Agent name (mobile-cbl-macosx-02) and jnlp secret string are needed by the ansible-playbook
